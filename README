listm, a list manager in python

Setup
=====
# Make the directory ~/.listm
# Run python listm_setup.py
# Link listmcli.py into your $PATH somehow. (Or: put listmcli.py in your path and make sure listm.py is in an appropriate place to get loaded)
# Optionally, make an alias from lm to listmcli.py to cut down on keyboarding time.
