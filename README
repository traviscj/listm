listm, a list manager in python

Setup
=====
# Make the directory ~/.listm
# Run python listm_setup.py
# Link listmcli.py into your $PATH somehow. (Or: put listmcli.py in your path and make sure listm.py is in an appropriate place to get loaded)
# Optionally, make an alias from lm to listmcli.py to cut down on keyboarding time.

Use
===
# Run listmcli.py or whatever you aliased it as.
# The main commands you'll use are:
## list/ls - lists all of the items
## new/n - create a new item
## changepar/mv - move an item into a subitem of another item
## rehead/cd - change 'head', so lists occur relative to a different location
## remove/rm - delete item
## quit/q - quit. since CTRL-D doesn't work, stupidly.
